# EcomEnhance – Unified E-Commerce Prototype

EcomEnhance is a prototype e-commerce platform built with **Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL** to unify fragmented retail operations for small and medium retailers.  
It integrates both **customer shopping flows** and **admin workflows** into one lightweight, secure, and scalable system.

This project demonstrates product thinking (problem discovery → analysis → MVP → execution) and full-stack development skills.

## 📖 Overview
EcomEnhance was built to address a common challenge faced by small retailers:

> **Multiple disconnected tools leading to inefficiency, errors, and poor customer experience.**

The platform provides:
- A **unified customer journey** (Signup → Browse → Cart → Checkout)  
- A **comprehensive admin dashboard** for inventory, order management, discounts, reports, and analytics  

The prototype runs locally using **SQLite/MySQL** and is designed to scale to PostgreSQL or cloud deployment.
